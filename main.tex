\section{Preface.}
\textsc{The} Brief Sketch of the Life of \textsc{Clarissa Lighthall}, which God taught her to commence
at the age of fifteen, and through the great fear of loser her own soul she dare not omit it,
although she accomplished it through much opposition and persecution. It discovers that the
rod of affliction caused her to humble herself at the foot of the cross, and to choose the better
part which Mary chose, which never shall be taken from her, and to imitate the woman who
washed Jesus' feet with her ears and wiped them with the hair of her head, in showing to
the world around what a dear Savior she as found, and pointing to his redeeming blood, say
behold the way to God; and also how the Prophets and Apostles felt when God discovered to
them the Thunder of his Power and elected them to stand betwixt the living and the dead.---
